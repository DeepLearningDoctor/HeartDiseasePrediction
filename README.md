# Heart Disease Prediction Flask App

![](/images/HeardiseasePrediction.png)
**Overview:**
This is a Flask web application for predicting the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on a subset of the heart disease dataset. The application uses machine learning (Logistic Regression) to make predictions based on three key features: age, serum cholesterol level (chol), and resting blood pressure (trestbps).

**Dataset:**
The dataset used in this project is a subset of the Kaggle heart disease dataset , containing 14 features. For this Flask app, we are specifically focusing on the following three features:

Age: Age of the patient in years.  
Chol: Serum cholesterol level in mg/dl.  
Trestbps: Resting blood pressure(mean arterial pressure) in mm Hg on admission to the hospital.

**Installation**
To run this Flask app locally, follow these steps:

Clone this repository using git clone commands or Git GUI

Run the Flask app:

python app.py
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000 to access the application.

Enter the patient's age, serum cholesterol level, and resting blood pressure.


Click the "Predict" button to see the prediction for the likelihood of heart disease.

**Machine Learning Model**
The machine learning model used for prediction is trained on the provided dataset. The model has been trained to classify whether a patient is likely to have heart disease based on the input features.
